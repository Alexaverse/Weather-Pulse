# Weather Pulse

**Weather Pulse** is a simple website that provides the current weather details of a city. The app fetches real-time weather data, including:
- Current temperature
- Weather description (e.g., sunny, cloudy, etc.)
- Wind speed
- Humidity levels

The site allows users to input a city name and instantly receive weather information.

## Features
- **Weather Information**: Displays the current weather details for any city input by the user.
- **Description**: Provides a brief description of the current weather condition (e.g., "clear sky", "cloudy", "rainy").
- **Wind Speed**: Shows the wind speed in meters per second.
- **Humidity**: Displays the current humidity percentage.
  
## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structure and layout.
- **CSS**: For styling and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: For functionality, fetching data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Used to fetch real-time weather data.

## How It Works
- The user enters a city name in the input field.
- Upon submission, the JavaScript fetches the weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- The app displays the current weather, wind speed, and humidity.
- If the city name is not found or the API call fails, an error message is shown.

## Acknowledgments
- Special thanks to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) for providing the free API for real-time weather data.
- The project was created for learning and experimentation with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
